# CPP Address Book
ICS 212 Program Structure - Project 02; Address Book (Fall 2015)
Address book project made in CPP, back in Fall 2015 semester, when I took ICS 212 Program Structure.

## Compile and Run with debug mode
### Compile debug mode with make:

Displays arguments passed into function.

## Uses
```
1 - Add a new node record
2 - Print data in node with given name
3 - Modify data in node with given name
4 - Print all nodes in liked list
5 - Delete an existing node with given name
6 - Reverse nodes from linked list
7 - Exit Program
```

## Issue
- Reverse list does not work properly. We were required to implement it recursively, and the solution I found online does not work too well.

If any ICS 212 students from Ravi's class comes across this. **BE AWARE**, I modified the code to not meet the majority of his requirements.
